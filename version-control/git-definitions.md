# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is the concept of maintaining the changes in code in an organized manner as to reduce introduction of errors that can take a while to debug if there is no way to revert back to a working copy. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is as the name suggests, a tangent in the main body of code. It allows for a developer to independently work on code to either add new features, optimize solutions, and debug or fix security exploits all without completely messing up with the original. If the developer fills like they have working code, it is sent to be analyzed, and then it is implemented (or merged) with the main code. 
  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?
