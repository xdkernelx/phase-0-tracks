#Notes on JQuery
##Nestor Alvarez

I am going to try something different here. Sometimes, the most efficient way to learn new things,
especially in the matter of coding isn't to go out and search for the information yourself.

In coding, if you have the possibility to do so, you can learn more from people who have already
done the robust research and implemented many tasks with current syntax and APIs.

As such, I plan on learning JQuery, not from Google and StackOverflow--although that will be used--
but from fellow members of my cohort. I plan on studying their implementations and seeing what makes
their code tick. 

For this exercise, I will looking at two people: paulliu87 and parkynj (GitHub usernames)
