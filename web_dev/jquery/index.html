      My devBootcamp cohort is the <b>SF Bobolinks of 2016</b>. We started doing the bare essentials of Web development on July 11, 2016. This page is intended for my ongoing training in Web development. As you can see from this, I am going to be honest and admit that I know very little of Web page formatting. This page looks terrible, but we all have to start somewhere. Thank you for your visit and feel free to check the "Phase 0" section.
