##Virtual Private Servers
A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. (Wikipedia)

From my understanding of things, the advantages of it are that is is scalable (can be upgraded to larger sizes and additional features with ease). Additionally, the setup time is merely several hours since you don't have to assemble a dedicated server. Based on resellerspanel.com, it may also be more secure to against well-known DDoS attacks. 

The root user is more or less the "boss" user. It is allowed to do virtually anything. If you run a program as a root user,  you are allowing that program, through proxy, to do anything it wants. If you have gotten a program from an untrusted source, you are potentially setting yourself up for a myriad of malware including root kits, viruses, and spyware.
